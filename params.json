This SDK provides convenient access to the HCP Anywhere FSS API. \r\n                                                                                                    \r\nIn order to make calls to the sub APIs, you must acquire an AuthToken. An AuthToken can be acquired from the server by calling the authenticate method, which requires you to provide the username and password you use to access HCP Anywhere. The returned AuthToken can be saved for later use.\r\n                                                                                                    \r\nOnce an AuthToken is acquired, you can make calls to the sub APIs by supplying the token and any other required arguments of the sub APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation \r\n\r\nJavadoc is available as a JAR via Maven Central or [via github](http://hitachi-data-systems.github.io/anywhere-fss-sdk/javadoc/).\r\n\r\n## Example                                                                                          \r\n                                            \r\n```\r\nAnywhereAPI api = new AnywhereAPI.Builder(\"https://myanywhere.example.com/\").build();\r\nAuthToken authToken = api.authenticate(\"jdoe\", \"passwd\");\r\nUser me = api.getUserAPI().getInfo(authToken);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA complete example is provided in the repository under /example.\r\n\r\n## Using the HCP Anywhere File Sync and Share SDK                                                       \r\n\r\nThe SDK is availble at Maven Central.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Questions?\r\n\r\nReach out to Hitachi Data Systems at our community portal http://community.hds.com.\r\n\r\n# Copyright and License\r\n\r\nCode and documentation copyright by Hitachi Data Systems, 2016.
