# HCP Anywhere File Sync and Share Java SDK                                                                  
                                                                                                    
The HCP Anywhere File Sync and Share API is an API for connecting to HCP Anywhere. This Java SDK provides convenient access to the HCP Anywhere FSS API. 
                                                                                                    
In order to make calls to the sub APIs, you must acquire an AuthToken. An AuthToken can be acquired from the server by calling the authenticate method, which requires you to provide the username and password or certificate you use to access HCP Anywhere. The returned AuthToken can be saved for later use.
                                                                                                    
Once an AuthToken is acquired, you can make calls to the sub APIs by supplying the token and any other required arguments of the sub APIs.
